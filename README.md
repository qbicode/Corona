# Corona
Corona related code and data sets.

I will publish some raw data related to clinical measures from the Bundesland Thuringia (Germany). The source of this data currently is a website of the Government of Thuringia ( https://www.landesregierung-thueringen.de/corona-bulletin ).

The data of the Government website itself has delays of up **two days** compared with the local health department (Gesundheitsamt) of the region.


**More raw data of other countries/regions:**
  * Italy (one data set per day)  https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19/blob/master/dati-andamento-nazionale/dpc-covid19-ita-andamento-nazionale.csv
